# Connect-Four

#Overview
For Project #1, I endeavored to make a connect four game. The user will play against another user with standard connect four rules involved. Design is set according to a theme chosen by the user. Player names and images change as per the theme chosen. Users can switch themes mid-game. Scores are included in the header, and updated as users finish games. Also included is a "new game" button which resets the board.
